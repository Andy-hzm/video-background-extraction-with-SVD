# 🎥 Video Background Extraction using SVD

**🛠️ Key Techniques:** *Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Power Iteration, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Python*

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project extracts a fixed/static background from a moving video by leveraging linear algebra techniques—specifically SVD and Power Iteration. It's useful in applications such as surveillance, motion detection, and video preprocessing.

## ⚙️ What This Project Does

- Loads a video and converts frames into a matrix representation
- Applies **SVD** to isolate the dominant low-rank structure (background)
- Uses **Power Iteration** to compute top singular vectors efficiently
- Outputs a single image that represents the static background
